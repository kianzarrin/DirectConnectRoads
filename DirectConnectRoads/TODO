1- if the road has medium pedestrian lanes DC does not connect because we don't want to hide pedestrian lanes
    - to fix this we need to cut only the median and not the road.
2- tram support:
    - because of 1 many tram roads are unsupported.
    - additionally once we fix 1 the problem will be that tram tracks cross median.
    - to fix this we need to take tram roads into consideration too when checking if segment is connected to segment.
